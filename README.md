## About the Flood Advisory System

In late 2023, we sought to find a way to inform faculty and students alike of flooding at Scarsdale High School so we can all get to school and go home safely. We wanted to measure rainfall live onsite and upload this to a website where we can display the rainfall in a visual manner, easily accessible on a website.

## What is on this repository?

This repository contains all the code for the club website at [communityengineers.web.app.](https://communityengineers.web.app/);

That is:
-The code to display the visual elements of the website.
-The algorithms for predicting and visualizing the water level on school grounds.
-Associated files including data files of elevation at Scarsdale High School used in the algorithm, a 3D satellite model of SHS, and a PDF of the Arduino code.
